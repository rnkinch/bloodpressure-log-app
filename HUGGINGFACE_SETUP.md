## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get a Hugging Face API Key (Optional)

The app works without an API key using fallback responses, but for full AI features:

1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
2. Create a free account
3. Go to Settings â†’ Access Tokens
4. Create a new token with "Read" permissions
5. Copy the token

### Step 2: Set Environment Variable

Add your Hugging Face API key to your environment:

```bash
# In your .env file or environment
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Application

```bash
# Stop your current containers
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and start with new environment
docker-compose up --build
```

## API Endpoints Added

### 1. Enhanced Analysis
```
GET /api/analysis/enhanced
```
Returns your existing statistical analysis enhanced with AI insights.

### 2. Ask Questions
```
POST /api/analysis/ask
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "Why is my blood pressure trending upward?"
}
```

### 3. Health Report
```
GET /api/analysis/report
```
Generates a comprehensive health report with AI insights.

## How It Works

### Without API Key (Fallback Mode)
- Uses pre-defined responses based on your data patterns
- Provides basic insights and recommendations
- Still functional but with limited AI capabilities

### With API Key (Full AI Mode)
- Connects to Hugging Face's medical AI models
- Provides natural language explanations
- Generates personalized recommendations
- Answers complex questions about your health data

## Models Used

### 1. **Medical Model**: `dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1`
- Specialized for medical text analysis
- Provides health-focused insights
- Better understanding of medical terminology

### 2. **Conversational Model**: `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`
- Good for Q&A interactions
- Provides natural, conversational responses
- Handles complex questions well

## Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: Your statistical analysis runs locally
- **Minimal Data Sharing**: Only necessary data is sent to Hugging Face
- **No Personal Information**: Only anonymized health metrics are shared
- **HTTPS Encryption**: All API calls are encrypted
- **Fallback Mode**: Works completely offline if needed

## Usage Examples

### Ask Questions Like:
- "What is a normal blood pressure range?"
- "Why is my blood pressure trending upward?"
- "How does smoking affect my readings?"
- "What lifestyle changes should I make?"
- "Are my recent readings concerning?"

### Get AI Insights On:
- Risk assessment explanations
- Trend analysis interpretations
- Lifestyle impact correlations
- Personalized recommendations
- Health pattern summaries

## Troubleshooting

### If AI Features Don't Work:
1. Check your API key is set correctly
2. Verify internet connection
3. Check browser console for errors
4. The app will fall back to basic responses if AI is unavailable

### If Responses Are Slow:
- Hugging Face API can take 2-5 seconds per request
- This is normal for AI model inference
- Consider caching responses for better performance

### If You Get Errors:
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify your API key has the correct permissions
- Ensure you haven't exceeded Hugging Face's free tier limits

## Free Tier Limits

Hugging Face provides:
- **30,000 requests per month** for free
- More than enough for personal use
- No credit card required

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Local Model Integration**: Use Ollama for completely offline AI
2. **Medical Model Fine-tuning**: Train models on blood pressure data
3. **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated health pattern recognition
4. **Integration with Wearables**: Connect with fitness trackers
5. **Telemedicine Integration**: Connect with healthcare providers

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your API key and permissions
3. Test with the debug endpoints
4. Check Hugging Face's API status

The app is designed to gracefully handle failures and provide useful responses even when AI services are unavailable.
