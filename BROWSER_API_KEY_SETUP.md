# Browser-Based API Key Setup Guide

## 🎉 New Feature: Browser-Based API Key Configuration

Your blood pressure app now supports **browser-based API key configuration**! This means you can enter your Hugging Face API key directly in the app without exposing it in your code or GitHub repository.

## 🔐 Security Benefits

- **No API keys in your code**: Your API key stays in your browser
- **Safe for GitHub**: No sensitive data in your repository
- **Local storage**: Your API key is stored locally in your browser
- **Privacy-first**: Your key never gets committed to version control

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Access the Enhanced AI Features
1. Open your blood pressure app
2. Click on the **"Enhanced AI"** tab
3. You'll see a new **"API Setup"** tab

2. Get your Hugging Face API key:
   - Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)

   - Go to Settings → Access Tokens
   - Create a new token with "Read" permissions
3. Paste your API key in the input field
4. Click **"Save & Validate"**

### Step 3: Enjoy Enhanced AI Features
Once your API key is configured:
