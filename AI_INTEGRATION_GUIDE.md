## Medical Knowledge Base

The AI system includes:

### Blood Pressure Categories
- **Normal**: 90-120/60-80 mmHg
- **Elevated**: 120-129/60-79 mmHg  
- **Stage 1 Hypertension**: 130-139/80-89 mmHg
- **Stage 2 Hypertension**: 140-179/90-119 mmHg
- **Hypertensive Crisis**: ≥180/≥120 mmHg

### Lifestyle Impact Factors
- **Smoking**: 15% hypertension risk increase
- **Alcohol**: Moderate (2 drinks) vs Heavy (4+ drinks) impact
- **Circadian Patterns**: Morning surge, afternoon dip, evening elevation

### Emergency Thresholds
- **Critical**: Systolic ≥180 OR Diastolic ≥120
- **Warning**: Systolic ≥140 OR Diastolic ≥90
- **Heart Rate**: <50 or >100 BPM alerts

## Future AI Enhancements

### Option 2: OpenAI/Claude Integration
```javascript
// Add to aiAnalysisService.js
async generateGPTInsights(readings, lifestyleData) {
  const prompt = `Analyze this blood pressure data: ${JSON.stringify(readings)}...`;
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }]
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}
```

### Option 3: Medical AI APIs
- **WebMD API**: Symptom analysis and recommendations
- **IBM Watson Health**: Medical knowledge integration
- **Google Health API**: Comprehensive health insights

### Option 4: Local Machine Learning
- **TensorFlow.js**: Client-side ML models
- **ONNX Runtime**: Optimized inference
- **Custom Models**: Trained on blood pressure datasets

## Technical Architecture

Frontend (React)
    ↓ API calls
Backend (Node.js + Express)
    ↓ Analysis
AI Analysis Service
    ├── Statistical Analysis
    ├── Medical Knowledge Base
    ├── Risk Assessment
    ├── Predictive Modeling
    └── Recommendation Engine
```

## Data Privacy & Security

- **Local Processing**: All analysis runs on your server
- **No External APIs**: Medical data stays private (unless you add external AI)
- **HIPAA Considerations**: Designed for health data privacy
- **Medical Disclaimers**: Proper legal disclaimers included

## Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Analysis results cached for 5 minutes
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking analysis generation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for service failures
- **Optimization**: Efficient algorithms for real-time analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Analysis Unavailable" Error**
   - Check backend server is running
   - Verify database has blood pressure readings
   - Check browser console for API errors

2. **"Insufficient Data" Message**
   - Add at least 2-3 blood pressure readings
   - Ensure readings span multiple days
   - Include lifestyle data for better analysis

3. **Low Confidence Score**
   - Increase reading frequency (daily recommended)
   - Extend tracking period (30+ days optimal)
   - Ensure consistent measurement timing

### Debug Mode:
```javascript
// Add to browser console for debugging
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
```

## Medical Disclaimer

## Next Steps

1. **Test the System**: Add some blood pressure readings and view the AI analysis
2. **Review Recommendations**: Check the personalized suggestions
3. **Monitor Alerts**: Watch for any medical alerts
4. **Extend Tracking**: Add lifestyle data for enhanced analysis
5. **Consider External AI**: Evaluate adding OpenAI/Claude for even more advanced insights

The system is now ready for production use with significantly more sophisticated AI-powered health analysis!
